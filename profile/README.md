## 🩺 The Clinic: Who We Are

We are the **Anti-Depressants Dev Team**. We are a chaotic collective of developers operating out of Japan and the darkest corners of the internet. Our mission is simple: create software that cures the chronic headaches caused by modern technology.

In an era where a calculator app requires an internet connection and a login, we provide the antidote. We build tools that are fast, stupidly simple, and respect your hardware.

## 👨‍⚕️ The Medical Staff (Meet the Team)

We are a mix of purists, leaders, and chaotic AI-wizards. Here is the roster behind the madness:

### 👑 **Luty** (aka [Yabosen](https://github.com/orgs/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/people/Yabosen))
* **Role:** The Leader / Head Pharmacist
* **Profile:** The glue holding this operation together. Luty directs the chaos, decides which "treatments" get released to the public, and ensures the team doesn't accidentally delete the production database.

### 🛠️ **Bendy** (aka [Megamer-studios](https://github.com/orgs/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/people/Megamer-studios))
* **Role:** The Purist / Non-AI Programmer
* **Profile:** The designated "Old School" surgeon. Bendy refuses to let a robot write his code. He writes every line by hand, fueled by spite and energy drinks. If it works, it’s because he willed it into existence. 
* **Philosophy:** *"If I didn't suffer writing it, you won't enjoy using it."*

### 🤖 **Fanta** (aka [OttoApocalypse69](https://github.com/orgs/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/people/OttoApocalypse69))
* **Role:** The Master of AI / The Hivemind
* **Profile:** A cyborg in human clothing. Fanta doesn't just use ChatGPT; he runs multiple LLMs simultaneously to hallucinate code into reality. He is the master of the prompt, bridging the gap between human thought and machine output.
* **Philosophy:** *"Why write code when I can prompt-engineer a god to do it for me?"*

## 👥 Our Users (The Patients)

Our software is prescribed for a specific kind of person. You are one of us if:
* You are tired of "Smart" features that are actually dumb.
* You miss the days when software opened instantly.
* You use `Notepad` because you just want to write text, not have a conversation with a chatbot.
* You have a low tolerance for unnecessary RAM usage.

## 📦 The Pharmacy (Repository Showcase)

### 🔥 **FEATURED: [Spice](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/spice)**
The secret ingredient. The newest addition to our shelf. Built with JavaScript to add the necessary flavor to your bland digital existence.

### 💊 **The Essentials**

* **[Notepad-Plus-Minus](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/Notepad-Plus-Minus)**: A Notepad clone that aggressively removes "Microslop" features. No Copilot, no markdown rendering, no cloud sync. Just you and the text buffer.
* **[MP-5](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/MP-5)**: A music player that plays music. That's it. No social features, no podcasts, just MP3s.
* **[LFGL (Lovely Fucking Game Launcher)](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/LFGL)**: Stop logging into three different accounts just to launch a game. LFGL cuts the crap and launches the executable.
* **[DepressedChat](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/DepressedChat)**: Communication for the weary. Yeah, bruh.
